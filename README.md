 - Clone the repo into a directory of your choice
 -   `cd` into that directory and run `npm install`
 - Use `npm start` to start a local webserver which will make the site available at http://localhost:8080/. Cross origin errors prevent this project from being accessed in the browser with the `file://` protocol. This will also trigger automatic builds and reloads of the page when changes are detected in the `src` directory.

 - If you want to manually cut a build of the application code run `npm run build`
